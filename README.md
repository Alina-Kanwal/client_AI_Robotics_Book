# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

A comprehensive guide to Physical AI using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## About This Book

This book provides a comprehensive introduction to Physical AI and humanoid robotics, covering essential concepts, tools, and techniques needed to develop intelligent physical systems. The content is organized into four main modules:

1. **ROS 2 - Robotic Nervous System**: The foundational framework for robot communication and control
2. **Digital Twins - Gazebo & Unity**: Simulation environments for testing and development
3. **AI Robot Brain - NVIDIA Isaac**: Perception, navigation, and manipulation systems
4. **Vision-Language-Action Systems**: Integrating LLMs and voice commands for robot control

## Building the Book

This book is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```bash
cd website
npm install
```

### Local Development

```bash
cd website
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
cd website
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to Vercel using the workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Vercel automatically detects and builds the Docusaurus project.

To deploy manually, you can use the Vercel CLI:
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to Vercel from the project root
vercel --prod
```
